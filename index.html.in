<p>pyemf is a pure python module that provides bindings for an <a
href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-234.htm">ECMA-234</a>
compliant vector graphics library.  ECMA-234 is the published
interface for the Windows GDI used in the Microsoft windows
environment and, more importantly, natively supported by the <a
href="www.openoffice.org">OpenOffice</a> suite of tools.  </p>


<h1>Why?</h1>

<p>This is the only way I could automate document generation via Python that:
<ol>
<li>uses vector (scalable) graphics
<li>allows bundling of multiple graphics files and text into a single file (via <a href="http://pyrtf.sourceforge.net">PyRTF</a>)</li>
<li>was cross platform (I had to support the Windows world)
</ol>
RTF files are supported by OpenOffice as well as (of course) Microsoft Word.</p>

<h1>History</h1>

<p> Not knowing anything about Windows graphics files, I stumbled upon
<a href="http://libemf.sourceforge.net">libEMF</a> and searched in
vain for a python binding for libEMF.  Not having found one, I
actually wrote a version 1.0 of pyemf using <a
href="http://www.swig.org">SWIG</a> to create a wrapper around
libEMF.</p>

<p>But, before even officially releasing pyemf 1.0, but decided to
write pyemf 2.0 as a pure python implementation .  That means that all
the time I spent building (and debugging!) pyemf 1.0 really became an
exercise to learn how SWIG works.  But, that's OK, because there were
a few features left out of libEMF that I can now add in without
waiting for them to be added to libEMF.</p>

<p>I've submitted patches to the maintainer of PyRTF and shortly will
to <a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/">Matplotlib</a>, I can
now generate RTF documents that include snazzy scientific plots.
These documents are modifiable by both Microsoft Word and OpenOffice
Writer, satisfying the need to be cross platform.</p>

<P>When SVG is understood by Word and OpenOffice (OpenDoc?), EMF will become
unnecessary, but this can fill the void in the meantime.</p>
