<h1>Version Numbers</h1>

<p>$prog follows the Python standard of version numbers for modules:
major.minor.patchlevel[subrelease].  From the <a
href="http://docs.python.org/dist/meta-data.html">distutils
docs</a>:</p>

<div class="cite">
The major number is 0 for initial, experimental releases of
software. It is incremented for releases that represent major
milestones in a package. The minor number is incremented when
important new features are added to the package. The patch number
increments when bug-fix releases are made. Additional trailing version
information is sometimes used to indicate sub-releases. These are
"a1,a2,...,aN" (for alpha releases, where functionality and API may
change), "b1,b2,...,bN" (for beta releases, which only fix bugs)
</div>

<P>Obviously, I'm not starting at major number 0.  See below.


<h1>History</h1>

<dl>
<dt>1.0.0 - <emph>Abandoned</emph></dt>
<dd>

<p>This was an almost-complete <a href="http://www.swig.org">SWIG</a>
wrapper around <a href="http://libemf.sourceforge.net">libEMF</a>.
But, it's harder to distribute a SWIG module that a pure python one,
and I also wanted to support a few more features than were available
in libEMF.</p>

</dd>



<dt>2.0.0 - <emph>Currently in development at version $version</emph></dt>
<dd>

<P>This is the current version.  I had to change major numbers because
the API changed from version 1.*.  At the time, I wasn't sure how long
it would take me to code up version 2.* and was thinking that I might
release version 1 in the interrim.</p>

<P>But, I was able to code up version 2.0.0b1 in a reasonable time,
but by then I was far enough along in my thinking that I just left the
version numbers alone.  A bit strange to release a version 2.* before
a 1.* became public, but given the amount of time I invested in
version 1.0.0 and debugging the SWIG interface, I at least want to
give a nod to myself for some good effort.</p>

<dt>2.1.0 - <emph>Future plans</emph></dt>
<dd>

<P>Things I'd like to support:</p>

<ul>
<li>understand the viewport origin and extent commands</li>
<li>understand the window origin and extent commands</li>
</ul>

</dd>

<P>&nbsp;</p>


<dt>2.x.0 - <emph>Way future plans</emph></dt>
<dd>

<P>Somewhere off in the distance...</p>

<ul>
<li>Font metrics.   Maybe.</li>
</ul>
