ABSTRACT
========

pyemf is a pure python module that provides bindings for an ECMA-234
compliant vector graphics library.  ECMA-234 is the published
interface for the Windows GDI used in the Microsoft windows
environment and, more importantly, natively supported by the
OpenOffice suite of tools.

PREREQUISITES
=============

python (tested under 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4)


QUICK INSTALL
=============

python setup.py install

Yep, that's pretty much it.



FEATURES
========

Most of the methods of ECMA-234 are supported by pyemf.  Exceptions
are noted below, but generally the font support is limited in pyemf.

  Drawing Parameters: GetStockObject, SelectObject, DeleteObject,
  CreatePen, CreateSolidBrush, CreateHatchBrush, SetBkColor,
  SetBkMode, SetPolyFillMode

  Drawing Primitives: SetPixel, Polyline, Polygon, Rectangle,
  RoundRect, Ellipse, Arc, Chord, Pie, PolyBezier

  Path Primatives: BeginPath, EndPath, MoveTo, LineTo, PolylineTo,
  ArcTo, PolyBezierTo, CloseFigure, FillPath, StrokePath,
  StrokeAndFillPath

  Text: CreateFont, SetTextAlign, SetTextColor, TextOut

  Coordinate System Transformation: SetWorldTransform,
  ModifyWorldTransform

Unsupported
-----------

Palettes, bitmaps, and text metrics.




EXAMPLES
========

Creating an EMF
---------------

Here's a simple program (available as test1.py in the distribution)
that connects opposite corners of an 8in by 6in rectangle with lines:

#!/usr/bin/env python

import pyemf

width=8
height=6
dpi=300

emf=pyemf.EMF(width,height,dpi)
thin=emf.CreatePen(PS_SOLID,1,(0x00,0x00,0x00))
emf.SelectObject(thin)
emf.Polyline([(0,0),(width*dpi,height*dpi)])
emf.Polyline([(0,height*dpi),(width*dpi,0)])
emf.save("test1.emf")


Examining an EMF
----------------

pyemf, when run as a standalone program, has the ability to read an
EMF and print out the contents.  Run:

$ pyemf.py -v test1.emf

and it will print out a text summary of all the metafile records in
the file.



KNOWN ISSUES
